# Update the Editor

PATH.JERRYIO is a Progressive Web Apps (PWA) that is installable and can be used without an internet connection. Unlike a normal website which can be updated by simply refreshing the page, PATH.JERRYIO is an offline-first app which means it has to be updated manually.

## Update Notification

When there is a new version available, a notification will be shown on the top left corner of the screen.
